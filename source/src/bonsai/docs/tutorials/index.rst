         :doc:`project0`
            In this introductory project, you'll learn the basics of using Bonsai to design a simple room.
            By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a basic 3D model and a 2D floor plan drawing.

         :doc:`project1`
            Building on the skills from Project 0, this tutorial will guide you through designing a complete flat using Bonsai.
            You'll learn more advanced techniques for creating walls and openings, working with profiles, defining rooms and spaces,
            and generating more detailed drawings.
