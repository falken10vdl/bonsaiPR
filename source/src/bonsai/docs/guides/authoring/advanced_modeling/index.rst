Advanced Modeling
=================

This chapter covers the advanced aspects of working with Bonsai. It is divided into three main sections:

.. only:: builder_html and (not singlehtml)

   .. container:: toc-cards
              
      .. container:: card

         :doc:`georeferencing`
            This section covers how to georeference models and work with georeferenced models

      .. container:: card

         :doc:`parametric_geometry`
            Bonsai provides tools for creating and editing parametric geometry for IFC elements.
            Parametric geometry allows you to define building elements using parameters that can be easily adjusted, rather than modeling fixed geometry.
            This Page shows you how to create parametric geometries

      .. container:: card

         :doc:`material_assignment`
            This section covers how to assign and customize materials in your BIM model using the Bonsai.
