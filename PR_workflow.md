## Workflow for Pull Requests

**TL;DR:** If your PR is ready to be pulled into the main branch, **please click the _“Ready for review”_ button**.

*We’re trying something new to keep great contributions from going stale.*

### 🧭 The Problem

Many excellent PRs are submitted by contributors, but core maintainers have limited time for timely reviews.  As a result, PRs often sit unmerged, contributors lose momentum, and valuable work risks being forgotten.

### 🛠️ The Solution: `bleeding_edge` Branch

We’ve created a **`bleeding_edge`** branch that **automatically merges all PRs marked as ready**.  
“Ready” simply means the author has reviewed their own work and believes it’s fit for production.

* All incoming PRs will initially be marked as **Draft**.
* When your PR is ready, just click **“Ready for review”**.
  * *If you're a returning contributor, and already know of this approach, you can also just say in your PR comments that your PR is ready to be pulled.*  
* Your PR will then be **automatically merged** into the `bleeding_edge` branch.
* Power users can install this weekly build to **test multiple PRs together**, helping catch issues earlier and reducing the load on core developers.
